Time complexity
    Insert = O(1)
    Search = O(n)


LL uses Non-contiguous memory.
LL has variable size.


LinkedList is better than ArrayList for data manipulation operation (e.g add)
ArrayList is better than LinkedList for search operation.


Once we delete the node form LL, Garbage collector frees the memory of deleted node.
